# Chapter 11 — Maxwell's Equations and Electromagnetic Waves

*The payoff. Maxwell's addition completes the equations, and light falls out.*

---

In 1862, James Clerk Maxwell was working at King's College London on a mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism. He had taken Faraday's intuitive picture of fields filling space and translated it into equations. Coulomb, Ampère, Faraday — he had them all. And then he found a contradiction.

The pre-Maxwell version of Ampère's law says: the line integral of $\vec{B}$ around any closed loop equals $\mu_0$ times the current passing through that loop. Take a wire charging a capacitor. Draw an Amperian loop around the wire. Now choose two different surfaces bounded by that same loop: a flat disk pierced by the wire, and a bag-shaped surface that slips between the capacitor plates. Both surfaces share the same boundary — the loop — so Ampère's law gives the same left-hand side. But the right-hand sides differ. The flat disk has a real current through it. The bag, which threads through the gap between the plates where no charge moves, has no current through it at all. Same loop, same equation, two different answers.

Maxwell's fix was to add a term. Where pre-Maxwell Ampère saw only current as the source of $\vec{B}$, Maxwell added the *changing electric flux* as an equally valid source:

$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{\ell} = \mu_0 I_{\text{enc}} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}$$

The extra term is the **displacement current** $I_d = \varepsilon_0\, d\Phi_E/dt$. Between the capacitor plates, the electric flux is growing as charge builds; the displacement current through the bag-shaped surface exactly equals the conduction current through the flat disk. Contradiction resolved.

Then Maxwell did something else. He asked: in a vacuum — no charges, no currents — are there nontrivial solutions to the completed equations? And he found oscillating ones. And those oscillations have a speed:

$$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0}}$$

Plugging in the measured values of $\mu_0$ and $\varepsilon_0$, which had been determined from electrostatic and magnetostatic bench experiments with no reference to light:

$$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(4\pi \times 10^{-7})(8.854 \times 10^{-12})}} \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$$

That is the speed of light, measured by Fizeau and Foucault in the 1850s. In 1864, Maxwell wrote: *"We can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena."*

Every equation in the ten preceding chapters was building toward this moment.

## The four equations

Here, together for the first time, are Maxwell's equations in integral form. Each one is a chapter you've already read.

$$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0} \tag{1}$$

$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = 0 \tag{2}$$

$$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{\ell} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \tag{3}$$

$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{\ell} = \mu_0 I_{\text{enc}} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt} \tag{4}$$

Equation (1) is Gauss's law from Chapter 3: electric flux through any closed surface equals the enclosed charge divided by $\varepsilon_0$. Equation (2) is Gauss's law for magnetism from Chapter 9: no magnetic monopoles. Equation (3) is Faraday's law from Chapter 10: changing magnetic flux drives circulation of the electric field. Equation (4) is Ampère's law from Chapter 9, plus Maxwell's new term.

The four equations say everything. Every electric and magnetic phenomenon — static fields, circuits, induction, light, radio, X-rays — follows from them. The rest of physics, including quantum mechanics, is a separate subject. But the classical electromagnetic world is entirely encoded here.

<!-- → [TABLE: four Maxwell equations — columns: number, name, integral equation, physical content in plain English, chapter where it was introduced] -->

For students who have seen divergence and curl, the differential forms are:

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \rho/\varepsilon_0, \qquad \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0, \qquad \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}, \qquad \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}$$

These are local statements at every point in space — equivalent to the integral forms via Stokes' theorem and the divergence theorem, but more elegant, and the form in which they're typically written in graduate physics.

## The displacement current

The added term in equation (4) deserves careful attention, because it is the thing that makes everything else in this chapter possible.

$I_d = \varepsilon_0\, d\Phi_E/dt$ has units of current but is not a flow of charge. It is the magnetic effect of a *changing electric field*. Before Maxwell, the known sources of $\vec{B}$ were: moving charges (steady currents). After Maxwell, the sources are: moving charges *and* changing electric flux.

Symmetry-seekers will notice what this does: Faraday's law (equation 3) says changing $\vec{B}$ creates circulating $\vec{E}$. Maxwell's addition to equation (4) says changing $\vec{E}$ creates circulating $\vec{B}$. The two fields can create each other. And when they do, the creation is self-sustaining. A changing $\vec{E}$ makes a changing $\vec{B}$; that changing $\vec{B}$ makes a changing $\vec{E}$; which makes a changing $\vec{B}$; and so on, propagating through empty space.

That propagation is light.

---

## The wave equation

In a source-free vacuum — no charges, no currents — Maxwell's equations become:

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = 0, \qquad \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0, \qquad \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}, \qquad \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}$$

Take the curl of the third equation:

$$\nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec{E}) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla \times \vec{B}) = -\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \vec{E}}{\partial t^2}$$

Apply the vector identity $\nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec{E}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \vec{E}) - \nabla^2 \vec{E}$. In source-free vacuum, $\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = 0$, so the first term vanishes:

$$\boxed{\nabla^2 \vec{E} = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \vec{E}}{\partial t^2}}$$

This is the wave equation. Compare it to the standard form $\nabla^2 f = (1/v^2)\,\partial^2 f/\partial t^2$: the wave speed is $v = 1/\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0} = c$. An identical derivation starting from the fourth equation gives the same wave equation for $\vec{B}$.

The manipulation is clean, but the surprise is not in the algebra. The surprise is that $\mu_0$ and $\varepsilon_0$ were measured independently — one from the force between magnets, one from the force between charges — and their product, when combined here, gives $1/c^2$. Maxwell did not put $c$ into the equations. He found it there.

## Plane wave solutions

The simplest solutions to the wave equation are **plane waves** — fields that depend only on one spatial coordinate and time. For a wave propagating in the $+\hat{x}$ direction:

$$\vec{E}(x, t) = E_0 \cos(kx - \omega t)\,\hat{y}, \qquad \vec{B}(x, t) = B_0 \cos(kx - \omega t)\,\hat{z}$$

Substituting into Maxwell's equations in vacuum yields three constraints that the fields must satisfy:

**Dispersion**: $\omega = ck$, equivalently $\lambda f = c$. The wave's temporal and spatial oscillation rates are tied together by the wave speed.

**Amplitude ratio**: $E_0 = cB_0$. In SI units, $E$ is much larger than $B$ in absolute terms — for sunlight at Earth, $E_0 \approx 870$ V/m while $B_0 \approx 2.9$ µT. The ratio $E_0/B_0 = c \approx 3 \times 10^8$ m/s.

**Transverse geometry**: $\vec{E}$, $\vec{B}$, and the propagation direction are mutually perpendicular. $\vec{E} \times \vec{B}$ points along the propagation direction. Neither $\vec{E}$ nor $\vec{B}$ has a component along the propagation direction. This is not an assumption — it follows from $\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = 0$ in vacuum: the spatial variation of a plane wave along $\hat{x}$ requires the field components perpendicular to $\hat{x}$ to be the wave.

**Polarization** is the direction of $\vec{E}$ in the transverse plane. Linear polarization: $\vec{E}$ oscillates back and forth along a fixed direction. Circular: $\vec{E}$ rotates while maintaining constant magnitude. Elliptical: the general case. Sunlight is unpolarized — a superposition of all polarization orientations; a polarizing filter selects one.

## Energy and the Poynting vector

Where is the energy in an electromagnetic wave?

The energy density of an EM field is

$$u = \frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_0 E^2 + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}$$

The first term is the electric energy density from Chapter 5. The second is the magnetic energy density. In a plane wave, they are equal at every instant: $u_E = u_B$. You can verify this from $E_0 = cB_0$ and $c = 1/\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}$ — the numbers work out exactly.

The energy flux — power per unit area carried by the wave — is described by the **Poynting vector**:

$$\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vec{E} \times \vec{B}$$

The direction is along propagation (since $\vec{E} \times \vec{B}$ points that way). The magnitude $|\vec{S}|$ is the instantaneous power per unit area passing through a surface perpendicular to the propagation direction. For a plane wave, $\vec{S}$ oscillates in time; the time-averaged intensity is:

$$I = \langle|\vec{S}|\rangle = \frac{E_0^2}{2\mu_0 c} = \frac{c\varepsilon_0 E_0^2}{2}$$

For sunlight at Earth's surface: $I \approx 1000$ W/m². Plug in to find the peak fields: $E_0 \approx 870$ V/m, $B_0 \approx 2.9$ µT.

This is also the result Feynman found strange enough to spend several lectures on. In a simple DC circuit, the energy does not flow through the wires — it flows through the electromagnetic field surrounding the wires, described by exactly this Poynting vector. The wires guide the field; the field carries the energy. The result surprised many when it was first understood, and it should surprise you too.

EM waves also carry momentum. For a wave with intensity $I$ hitting a surface:

$$P_{\text{rad}} = I/c \text{ (absorbed)}, \qquad P_{\text{rad}} = 2I/c \text{ (perfectly reflected)}$$

Solar radiation pressure at Earth: roughly $9 \times 10^{-6}$ N/m² — small enough to ignore for most purposes, but real enough to matter for spacecraft trajectory planning and to provide the thrust for solar sails. JAXA's IKAROS spacecraft, launched in 2010, was the first to demonstrate interplanetary propulsion by photon pressure alone.

## The electromagnetic spectrum

All electromagnetic waves obey the same wave equation and travel at the same speed $c$ in vacuum. They differ only in frequency — and therefore in wavelength ($\lambda = c/f$) and in photon energy ($E = hf$, though that's Chapter 13's quantum story).

Radio waves and gamma rays are not different phenomena that happen to share a name. They are literally the same wave — Maxwell's oscillating fields — separated by fourteen orders of magnitude in frequency. That their effects are so different (you can hear a radio wave's effect through a speaker; a gamma ray's effect is ionizing radiation that damages DNA) is a consequence of how much energy each photon carries and how matter responds to fields at different frequencies. The underlying wave is one thing.

<!-- → [TABLE: electromagnetic spectrum — columns: region name, approximate frequency range, approximate wavelength, photon energy range, representative applications — rows from radio through gamma] -->

The span from radio to gamma is not the full story. Below radio, there are extremely-low-frequency (ELF) waves used to communicate with submerged submarines; above gamma, there is no known upper limit. The entire range is one family.

## Hertz's confirmation

Maxwell predicted EM waves in 1864. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz at Karlsruhe deliberately generated and detected them for the first time.

His apparatus: a spark-gap oscillator, essentially a capacitor discharging rapidly through an inductor, producing oscillations near 100 MHz. His detector: a small wire loop across the lab, sized to be resonant at the same frequency. When the oscillator fired, sparks appeared in the detector loop — even when the detector was shielded from the oscillator's light.

Hertz then did exactly what a physicist should do: he measured. He showed the waves propagate at $c$ by reflecting them off a metal wall and producing standing waves whose spacing he measured. He showed they could be reflected, refracted, and polarized — all properties of Maxwell's predicted transverse oscillations. His experiments were definitive.

Hertz reportedly dismissed the practical implications: *"It's of no use whatsoever... this is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right."* Marconi began commercial radio telegraphy between England and Newfoundland in 1901, fourteen years after Hertz's experiment, four years after Hertz's death. Every wireless device in the world runs on the physics Hertz confirmed.

## Worked example: the displacement current in a charging capacitor

A parallel-plate capacitor with plate area $A$ and separation $d$ is charging at rate $dV/dt$. Show that the displacement current between the plates equals the conduction current in the wire.

**Conduction current.** The charge on the plates is $Q = CV = (\varepsilon_0 A/d)V$. The current in the wire is $I_c = dQ/dt = (\varepsilon_0 A/d)(dV/dt)$.

**Electric flux between the plates.** The field between (parallel-plate approximation) is $E = V/d$. The flux through a surface placed between the plates is $\Phi_E = EA = VA/d$.

**Displacement current through that surface:**

$$I_d = \varepsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt} = \varepsilon_0 \cdot \frac{A}{d} \cdot \frac{dV}{dt}$$

This equals $I_c$ exactly. The flat disk surface (real current) and the bag-shaped surface (no real current, only growing flux) give the same answer for the Ampère-Maxwell integral. The added term is not an approximation or a patch — it is required by charge conservation.

**Numbers.** With $A = 10^{-4}$ m², $d = 10^{-3}$ m, $dV/dt = 10^6$ V/s:

$$I_c = I_d = \frac{(8.85 \times 10^{-12})(10^{-4})}{10^{-3}} \times 10^6 \approx 0.9 \text{ µA}$$

Small, but measurable. And the magnetic field this displacement current creates between the plates is the same as if a wire had carried 0.9 µA through the gap. Maxwell's term is physically real.

## Common misconceptions

**"Maxwell invented the displacement current to make his equations consistent."** The displacement current is required by charge conservation, not by mathematical aesthetics. At a charging capacitor, the pre-Maxwell equations violate charge conservation in non-steady situations. The fix restores conservation; mathematical consistency is a consequence.

**"The displacement current is a real flow of charge between the plates."** No. In a vacuum gap, no charge moves. The displacement current is the magnetic effect of a changing electric field. It has the units and the magnetic consequences of a current, but it is not a movement of charge.

**"Light is a different phenomenon from radio waves."** Same wave, different frequency. One equation, one speed, fourteen decades of frequency.

**"Light travels at $c$ everywhere."** In vacuum. In a dielectric with constant $\kappa$ and relative permeability $\mu_r$, the wave speed is $c/\sqrt{\kappa\mu_r}$. In glass, roughly $2 \times 10^8$ m/s. This slowing is the basis of refraction and of fiber-optic dispersion management.

## What would change my mind

Maxwell's equations are exact in the classical domain. A confirmed deviation at any scale where classical EM currently works would force a rewrite — none has been found. At very small scales, quantum electrodynamics supersedes them; the classical equations are the appropriate limit. At cosmological scales, general relativity provides corrections; for laboratory work these are immeasurable.

Hertz's 1887 experiment confirmed the predicted waves exist and propagate at $c$. The century-plus of engineering that followed — radio, radar, television, fiber optics, mobile phones, GPS — has been continuous engineering validation. When Maxwell's equations predict the gain of an antenna, the cutoff frequency of a waveguide, or the dispersion of a pulse in optical fiber, they are right.

## Still puzzling

*Why is $\mu_0\varepsilon_0 = 1/c^2$?* In SI units this looks like a numerical coincidence. In natural units where $c = 1$, it's a tautology. The deeper structure is that Maxwell's equations are Lorentz-covariant — $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are components of a single antisymmetric tensor, mixed into each other by changes of reference frame. The "coincidence" is the covariance; the speed of light is not a property of light specifically but of the geometry of spacetime.

*The displacement current and the photon.* In quantum electrodynamics, what classical theory calls a displacement current corresponds to virtual-photon exchange. The oscillating field that carries the wave is quantized into photons. The classical picture is the smooth limit of a quantum process.

*The asymmetry between $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$.* Equation (1) has a source on the right-hand side: charge. Equation (2) has zero. If magnetic monopoles existed, equation (2) would acquire a source term, and the full symmetry between $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ in Maxwell's equations would be restored. Without them, the equations are asymmetric in a way that has no deep theoretical explanation — only the empirical fact that no monopole has ever been found.
